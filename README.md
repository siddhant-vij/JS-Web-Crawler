# Web Crawler

To rank well in Google Search, websites need to internally link pages to one another. This is a web crawler built with Node.js that reports on the internal linking profile of any website. A tool any SEO expert would be lucky to have.

## Future Improvements
- Update the README file explaining the features, and how to get started.
- Make the script run on a timer and deploy it to a server. Have it email you every so often with a report.
- Add more robust error checking so that you can crawl larger sites without issues.
- Count external links, as well as internal links, and add them to the report
- Save the report as a CSV spreadsheet rather than printing it to the console
- Use a graphics library to create an image that shows the links between the pages as a graph visualization
- Make requests concurrently to speed up the crawling process
